{"name":"Computational Social Science in Python","tagline":"Useful IPython Notebooks for learning Computational Social Science techniques","body":"**Neal Caren** - University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill\r\n[mail](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu)\r\n[web](http://nealcaren.web.unc.edu)\r\n[twitter](http://twitter.com/HaphazardSoc)\r\n[scholar](http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=cy0u16kAAAAJ&hl=en)\r\n\r\n\r\nI’ve compiled a list of Python tutorials and annotated analyses. I've tried to list pages that are accessible to social scientists with little background in Python and/or machine learning. The list includes the packages that I've found most useful, such as Pandas and scikit-learn learn. Many are IPython Notebooks, so they can be downloaded and run locally. \r\n\r\nIf you are totally new to Python, I would recommend installing Continuum's [Anacoda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) Python distribution. It works on Macs and Windows, makes using IPython notebooks trivial, and solves most of the problems associated with installing various packages. \r\n\r\nIf you know of anything I've left out or if links go dead, please let [me](http://twitter.com/HaphazardSoc) [know](mailto:neal.caren@unc.edu).\r\n\r\n\r\n__Walkthroughs__\r\n\r\nOne of the great things about IPython notebooks is that they can easily blend text and code. This has led to a sharp increase in the number of data analysis projects where people carefully explain an entire research project, including data collection/importation, management and analysis. The code is right there, and you can usually run it and/or modify yourself. Looking at a few of these is an excellent introduction to what people are currently doing, even if you don't understand everything.\r\n\r\n* [Diving into Open Data with IPython Notebook & Pandas](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.githubusercontent.com/jvns/talks/master/pycon2014/bike_paths.ipynb?create=1) by [Julia Evans](http://twitter.com/b0rk). An analysis of whether people bike when it rains using Pandas.\r\n\r\n* [The Need for Openness in Data Journalism](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/brianckeegan/Bechdel/blob/master/Bechdel_test.ipynb) by [Brian Keegan](https://twitter.com/bkeegan)  Reanalysis of a 538 posts on the Bechdel Test and films using Pandas and statsmodels. When I ran this one, I had an issue with the BeautifulSoup part.u\r\n\r\n* [Predicting customer churn with scikit-learn](http://blog.yhathq.com/posts/predicting-customer-churn-with-sklearn.html) by [Eric Chiang](https://github.com/EricChiang). I don't care about customer churn, but it's a well-written walkthrough of machine learning classification.\r\n\r\n* [538 Model](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/raw.githubusercontent.com/jseabold/538model/master/silver_model.ipynb) by [Skipper Seabold](https://twitter.com/jseabold). Recreation of the classic 538 prediction model using Pandas.\r\n\r\n* [Heat and Violence in Chicago](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/brianckeegan/WeatherCrime/blob/master/Analysis.ipynb?create=1) by [Brian Keegan](https://twitter.com/bkeegan).

Predict winners of World Cup soccer matches using the [PyBrain](http://pybrain.org/) library for machine learning. Data is also on [Github](https://github.com/fisadev/world_cup_learning). \r\n\r\n__Using APIs__\r\n\r\nWhen a service wants you to use their data, they often provide it through an API. There are often specific Python libraries for accessing popularing, complex and/or APIs requiring authentication. Otherwises, [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) is quite useful. \r\n\r\n* [Mining Twitter: Exploring Trending Topics, Discovering What People Are Talking About, and More](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ptwobrussell/Mining-the-Social-Web-2nd-Edition/blob/master/ipynb/Chapter%201%20-%20Mining%20Twitter.ipynb) by [Matthew Russell](http://twitter.com/ptwobrussell\r\n[http://newcoder.io/api/)\r\n* [Sushi Bars and Buffets: Measuring local culture with the Yelp API](http://nealcaren.github.io/sushi_bars.html) by [me](https://twitter.com/haphazardsoc). Using the Yelp API to gather data about local food cultures and how they vary by SES.\r\n\r\n__Web Scraping__\r\n\r\nWhen they don't want to give you the data, you can sometimes grab it anyway by visiting one or more web pages and then extracting the parts you need. [requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/) is a useful library for accessing web pages, and [BeautifulSoup](http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) is a popular choice for pulling out the good stuff. If you don't know any HTML, [regular expressions](https://docs.python.org/2/library/re.html) can sometimes work well too. \r\n\r\n* [Intro to Beautiful Soup](http://programminghistorian.org/lessons/intro-to-beautiful-soup) by [Jeri Wieringa](http://jerielizabeth.github.io/). Turning a table on a website into a CSV file.

Grabbing lacrosse scores and turning them into a CSV file.\r\n\r\n__Data Management__\r\n\r\nGoing for raw data--numbers of words--to Xs that can be included in a regression equation is about 80% of the work. There's a lot of data management in the walkthroughs, but I've found a couple of others that show the process quite clearly. [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is popular and super useful, especially the data frames.\r\n\r\n* [Intro to pandas data structures](http://www.gregreda.com/2013/10/26/intro-to-pandas-data-structures/) by [Greg Reda](https://twitter.com/gjreda).

Sociologists usually learn about factor analysis and then never use it.\r\n\r\n* [Unsupervised Learning In-depth: PCA and K-Means](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jakevdp/sklearn_pycon2014/blob/master/notebooks/05_unsupervised_in_depth.ipynb) by [Jake Vanderplas](http://www.vanderplas.com/). \r\n* [Topics extraction with Non-Negative Matrix Factorization](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ogrisel/notebooks/blob/master/nmf_topics.ipynb?create=1) by [Oliver Grisel](https://twitter.com/ogrisel). It isn't topic models, but it's close and it's in scikit-learn.\r\n\r\n__Regression__\r\n\r\nWhile continuous outcomes are common in the social sciences, machine learning folks rarely talk about them. \r\n\r\n* [Multiple Regression using Statsmodels](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/s3.amazonaws.com/datarobotblog/notebooks/multiple_regression_in_python.ipynb) by by [DataRobot](http://www.datarobot.com/blog/).

Minimally commented but clear code for using Pandas and scikit-learn to find most important features.\r\n\r\n__Networks__\r\n\r\n[NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io) and [igraph](http://igraph.sourceforge.net) are both fairly powerful tools for network analysis. I don't think you can use them for regression analysis, but  you can use them to do things like compute centrality measures and make pretty pictures. You can also use Python to create/manipulate your network data for analysis/display elsewhere.   \r\n\r\n* [Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon](http://graphlab.com/learn/notebooks/graph_analytics_movies.html) by Brian Kent.

[seaborn](http://www.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/) makes it prettier. Other programs, like [mpld3](http://mpld3.github.io), [Plotly](https://plot.ly), or [bokeh](http://bokeh.pydata.org) are also worth trying out, especially for putting stuff together on the web.\r\n\r\n* [Plotting and Visualization](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/urls/gist.github.com/fonnesbeck/5850463/raw/a29d9ffb863bfab09ff6c1fc853e1d5bf69fe3e4/3.+Plotting+and+Visualization.ipynb) by [Chris Fonnesbeck](http://stronginference.com).
